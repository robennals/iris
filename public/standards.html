                We want Iris Talk to be a place for civil and socially beneficial discussion between people who trust each other. 
                The following behaviors will not be tolerated:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Impersonation:</strong> Users or groups pretending to be people or groups that they aren't.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Uncivil behavior:</strong> Including bullying, harassment, physical threats, or calls for extra-legal violence. It's okay to disagree with people, or to criticise their actions, but you should not do so in a way that implies that other people are unworthy of empathy.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Objectionable Content:</strong> Including posting content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, or is in expectionally poor taste.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Copyright violation:</strong> Including links to violating content elsewhere.
            Other Anti-social behavior: We reserve the right to take action against users for behavior not listed in this document, if we conclude, at our discetion, that it is harmful to the broader Talkful community.
            </ul>

            <p>These rules will be stricly enforced and people or groups that violate them may be permenantly banned from Iris Talk.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, group admins may choose to impose stricter rules on the conduct of their group members.
            </p>
            <p>You can report abusive users or groups using the "report abuse" button inside the app. Alteratively, you can email us at <a href='mailto:abuse@iris-talk.com'>abuse@iris-talk.com</a></p>
